## Organic Chemistry Assistant 
A tool made to help people with organic chemistry. I plan on adding new features to this project indefinately.

### Features
- **Draws Chemical Structures**: Converts SMILES notations into visual molecular structures, enabling a better understanding of molecular geometry.
- **Calculates Molecular Weights**: Utilizes SMILES notations to assist with formula creation and stoichiometry.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple command-line interface that's accessible.

### Built With
- **RDKit**: An open-source cheminformatics software.
- **Matplotlib**: A Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repository**: Get a copy of the source code on your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure to install RDKit and Matplotlib.
3. **Run the Tool**: Follow the on-screen prompts to utilize the tool's features.

### Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
pip install rdkit
pip install matplotlib
